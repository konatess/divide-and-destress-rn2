# divide-and-destress-rn2

A goal tracking app for those projects that need a little effort on a regular basis. Ideal for students managing long-term assignments, or avid readers trying to hit a monthly goal. Choose words, pages, or chapters, or add your own units. Then simply put in a start and end unit and a due date, and you will get regular reminders about how much you need to do each day to accomplish your goal.
